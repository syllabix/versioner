# `versioner`
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/syllabix/versioner)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/syllabix/versioner)

compute semantic versions and generate changelogs with 3 opinions:

1. your project is versioned using `git`.
2. commit messages in the repository follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/) standard
3. releases are tagged with [annotated tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

## `versioner` obectives

a. be a simple tool to use

b. Follow two conventions

1. [Conventional Commits v1.0.0-beta.3](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/) - describes the syntactic convention to use in a commit message (which this program attempts to parse and derive a meaningful version number from)

2. [Semver 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) - a known convention for providing meaningful versions to software.

c. Derive an accurate semantic version number from a `git` managed history that uses tags to mark versions.

d. Output a meaningful changelog.


### usage

this project is in a pre release state, and can be installed in two ways:

1. install from source:
you will need the [Go tooling installed](https://golang.org/dl/). then run:

    `go get -u github.com/syllabix/versioner/cmd/versioner`

2. Download a binary from the from the latest built release [here](https://github.com/syllabix/versioner/releases)

Once downloaded - and ensuring the binary is in your system `PATH` - simply navigate into a git repostory and run `versioner`. if your repository is using conventional commits, a meaningful version should be output

```
  // possible flags
  -nolog
        disable generating change log
  -o string
        sets the name of the output file (default "CHANGELOG.md")
  -print-scopes
        print all found scopes delimited by space since most recent annotated tag
  -v    print the current version of the binary
```

### roadmap
1. improve performance
2. handle pre release versions in a way more reflective of reasonable use cases semver standards.
3. installable via homebrew
4. installable via chocolatey
4. installable via apt-get
